# papirus-netapp
A Network appliance for the PaPiRus from PiSupply

I have now cleaned up some of the code and added a new menu to run the Appliance headless.

Changes (31st December 2017)

1) Added code to generate One Time Passwords. 
2) Removed GPIPZero based button actions as native GPIO button code is more responsive

If you wish to use this feature you will need to add your codes to the new veriables 

google
and
lastpass

You can change these, remove this us only one code etc.

How to get your Google authenticaor code for Google Accounts: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en

On this step - click "CAN'T SCAN IT" to get the code

You will get a code in a box, you do not need to worry about the spaces:
